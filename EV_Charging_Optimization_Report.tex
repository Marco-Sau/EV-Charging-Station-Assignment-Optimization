\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This report presents the Ev\_Nearest\_Charger project, a comprehensive solution to the Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Assignment Optimization problem using advanced network flow algorithms. The system implements a two-phase optimization approach: Phase 1 employs Dijkstra's algorithm for feasibility analysis and energy-constrained shortest path computation, while Phase 2 utilizes three minimum cost flow (MCF) algorithms—Successive Shortest Path (SSP), Cycle-Canceling, and Minimum Mean Cycle Canceling (MMCC)—to achieve globally optimal assignments. The solution is validated on both synthetic demo scenarios and real-world Cagliari transportation data, demonstrating optimal performance with sub-millisecond execution times and significant cost reductions compared to unoptimized assignments. The implementation follows textbook network flow theory principles and provides a production-ready system for urban EV fleet management.

\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Formulation}

\subsection{Problem Definition and Variables}

The EV Charging Assignment Problem can be formally characterized as a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes system costs while satisfying complex operational constraints across multiple dimensions.

\subsubsection{Network Structure}
The mathematical foundation rests upon a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ that represents the complete road network infrastructure available for electric vehicle routing. The node set $V$ encompasses the union of three distinct node types: $V = V_{EV} \cup V_{CS} \cup V_{R}$, where $V_{EV}$ represents electric vehicle starting locations, $V_{CS}$ denotes charging station positions, and $V_{R}$ includes intermediate routing nodes that enable flexible path planning across the metropolitan area.

The edge set $E$ captures the transportation infrastructure through weighted connections where each edge $(i,j) \in E$ carries a triple weight specification $(d_{ij}, t_{ij}, e_{ij})$ representing the physical distance between nodes, expected travel time under normal traffic conditions, and estimated energy consumption for electric vehicle traversal. This multi-dimensional edge weighting enables simultaneous optimization across distance, time, and energy objectives while maintaining computational tractability.

\subsubsection{Decision Variables}
The optimization problem employs three categories of decision variables that capture different aspects of the assignment and routing decisions. Binary assignment variables $x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}$ indicate whether electric vehicle $i$ is assigned to charging station $j$, with $x_{ij} = 1$ representing a positive assignment and $x_{ij} = 0$ indicating no assignment between the vehicle-station pair.

Flow variables $f_{ij}^{(k)} \geq 0$ represent the flow quantity on edge $(i,j)$ attributable to electric vehicle $k$, enabling the mathematical representation of vehicle routing decisions within the network flow framework. These continuous variables support the minimum-cost flow formulation while maintaining compatibility with the discrete assignment decisions.

Path indicator variables $y_{ijk} \in \{0,1\}$ provide binary indicators where $y_{ijk} = 1$ signifies that electric vehicle $i$ utilizes edge $(j,k)$ in its route to the assigned charging station. These variables enable explicit path representation and constraint enforcement while supporting detailed routing analysis and validation.

\subsubsection{Parameters}
The mathematical model incorporates comprehensive parameter specifications that capture the operational characteristics of both electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. Vehicle-specific parameters include current battery levels $B_i$ measured in kilowatt-hours, urgency classifications $u_i$ ranging from 1 (routine) to 3 (emergency), deadline constraints $D_i$ specified in minutes from the current time, and energy requirements $E_i$ representing the kilowatt-hours needed to achieve full battery capacity.

Infrastructure parameters characterize charging station capabilities through capacity specifications $C_j$ indicating the number of simultaneous charging slots available at station $j$, and electricity pricing $p_j$ measured in euros per kilowatt-hour that reflects the economic cost of energy delivery. These parameters enable comprehensive cost modeling while ensuring that capacity constraints are properly represented in the optimization formulation.

\subsection{Energy-Constrained Shortest Path (ECSP) Formulation}

The ECSP problem finds paths that minimize travel cost while satisfying battery constraints:

\subsubsection{Multi-Objective Label Structure}
Each label $L = (v, c, e, t, pred)$ represents:
\begin{align}
L.node &: \text{Current network node} \\
L.cost &: \text{Accumulated travel cost} \\
L.energy &: \text{Accumulated energy consumption} \\
L.time &: \text{Accumulated travel time} \\
L.pred &: \text{Predecessor label for path reconstruction}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Dominance Relation}
Label $L_1$ dominates $L_2$ at the same node if:
\begin{align}
L_1.cost &\leq L_2.cost \\
L_1.energy &\leq L_2.energy \\
L_1.time &\leq L_2.time \\
\text{with at least one strict inequality}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Feasibility Constraints}
The Energy-Constrained Shortest Path formulation enforces three fundamental feasibility requirements that must be satisfied for each potential path from electric vehicle $i$ to charging station $j$. The battery constraint ensures that the total energy consumption along path $P_{ij}$ does not exceed the vehicle's current battery capacity, formally expressed as $\sum_{(k,l) \in P_{ij}} e_{kl} \leq B_i$. This constraint prevents the assignment of routes that would result in battery depletion before reaching the charging destination.

The temporal feasibility requirement enforces deadline compliance through the constraint $\sum_{(k,l) \in P_{ij}} t_{kl} \leq D_i$, ensuring that the total travel time along the selected path does not exceed the vehicle's operational deadline. This constraint is particularly critical for emergency vehicles and time-sensitive commercial operations where schedule adherence is paramount.

Compatibility constraints ensure that only technically feasible vehicle-station pairs are considered, formally represented as $\text{Compatible}(i,j) = \text{True}$. This constraint accounts for charging standard compatibility, connector types, and any operational restrictions that might prevent successful charging even if the vehicle can physically reach the station.

\subsection{Minimum-Cost Flow (MCF) Formulation}

The MCF formulation provides globally optimal assignments:

\subsubsection{Network Flow Model}
\begin{align}
\min \quad &\sum_{i \in EV} \sum_{j \in CS} c_{ij} x_{ij} \\
\text{s.t.} \quad &\sum_{j \in CS} x_{ij} \leq 1 & \forall i \in EV \text{ (EV assignment)} \\
&\sum_{i \in EV} x_{ij} \leq C_j & \forall j \in CS \text{ (Station capacity)} \\
&x_{ij} \in \{0,1\} & \forall i,j \text{ (Binary assignment)} \\
&x_{ij} = 0 & \text{if } (i,j) \text{ infeasible by ECSP}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Comprehensive Cost Function}
The cost $c_{ij}$ for assigning EV $i$ to station $j$ includes:
\begin{align}
c_{ij} = &\ \alpha \cdot \text{TravelCost}_{ij} \\
&+ \beta \cdot \text{ChargingCost}_{ij} \\
&+ \gamma \cdot \text{UrgencyPenalty}_i \\
&+ \delta \cdot \text{TimePenalty}_{ij} \\
&+ \epsilon \cdot \text{EfficiencyBonus}_j
\end{align}

Where:
\begin{align}
\text{TravelCost}_{ij} &= d_{ij} \cdot 0.15 \text{ €/km} \\
\text{ChargingCost}_{ij} &= E_i \cdot p_j \\
\text{UrgencyPenalty}_i &= u_i \cdot 75 \\
\text{TimePenalty}_{ij} &= t_{ij} \cdot 1.5 \\
\text{EfficiencyBonus}_j &= -P_j \cdot 0.1
\end{align}

\subsection{Cycle-Canceling Algorithm for MCF}

\subsubsection{Residual Network Construction}
For each arc $(i,j)$ with capacity $u_{ij}$ and cost $c_{ij}$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Forward residual arc: capacity $u_{ij} - f_{ij}$, cost $c_{ij}$
    \item Backward residual arc: capacity $f_{ij}$, cost $-c_{ij}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Negative Cycle Detection}
Using Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect negative cycles:
\begin{align}
d[v] = \min(d[v], d[u] + c_{uv}) \quad \forall (u,v) \in E_{residual}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Flow Augmentation}
For detected negative cycle $C$ with bottleneck capacity $\Delta$:
\begin{align}
f_{ij} \leftarrow f_{ij} + \Delta \quad &\forall (i,j) \in C^+ \\
f_{ij} \leftarrow f_{ij} - \Delta \quad &\forall (i,j) \in C^-
\end{align}

\subsection{Performance Optimization Techniques}

\subsubsection{Dominance Pruning Optimization}
The system achieves significant computational efficiency improvements through sophisticated dominance checking mechanisms that eliminate inferior solutions during the search process. Early termination strategies enable quick dominance assessments before conducting full multi-dimensional comparisons, reducing computational overhead by identifying obviously dominated labels through simple bounds checking.

Lexicographic ordering techniques pre-sort labels according to primary optimization criteria, enabling faster dominance detection through ordered traversal rather than exhaustive pairwise comparison. This approach particularly benefits scenarios with large label sets where naive comparison would create quadratic computational complexity.

Bounded label set management limits label proliferation in dense networks by imposing intelligent upper bounds on the number of non-dominated labels maintained per node. This technique trades minor optimality guarantees for substantial computational efficiency improvements, particularly valuable in large-scale deployment scenarios.

\subsubsection{Memory Management}
Large-scale optimization requires careful memory management to maintain system performance and scalability. Label pooling mechanisms reuse label objects across multiple search iterations, reducing memory allocation overhead and garbage collection pressure during intensive optimization phases. This approach becomes particularly valuable in scenarios involving frequent re-optimization or dynamic problem instances.

Sparse representation techniques utilize specialized data structures optimized for large networks with relatively few connections per node, dramatically reducing memory footprint compared to dense matrix representations. These structures maintain fast access times while scaling efficiently with network size.

Incremental update mechanisms modify network structures progressively during optimization rather than reconstructing complete data structures for each iteration. This approach minimizes memory allocation churn while maintaining data consistency throughout the optimization process.

\subsubsection{Parallel Processing Opportunities}
The system architecture naturally supports several parallelization strategies that can significantly improve computational performance for large-scale deployments. ECSP parallelization exploits the independence of feasibility analysis across different electric vehicles, enabling simultaneous computation of feasible assignments for multiple vehicles without coordination overhead.

Network decomposition techniques partition large networks into manageable subproblems that can be solved independently before combining results through coordination mechanisms. This approach enables scalable processing of city-wide optimization problems that would be computationally intractable under sequential processing.

Multi-threaded flow update mechanisms enable parallel modification of residual network structures during the cycle-canceling phase, reducing the computational bottleneck associated with iterative flow improvements while maintaining algorithmic correctness.

The optimization achieved a perfect assignment success rate of 100\%, successfully assigning all 6 electric vehicles in the demonstration scenario to appropriate charging stations while satisfying all operational constraints including battery limitations, time deadlines, and compatibility requirements.

The feasibility analysis phase identified 18 viable EV-station combinations from the theoretical maximum of 24 possible pairings, indicating that the system's constraint enforcement successfully eliminated infeasible assignments while preserving all operationally viable options.
