\section{Introduction}

The rapid growth of electric vehicle adoption presents new challenges in urban transportation optimization. One critical problem is efficiently assigning electric vehicles to charging stations while minimizing total operational costs and respecting energy constraints. This report presents the EV Charging Station Assignment Optimization project, a comprehensive solution to the Electric Vehicle Charging Station Assignment Optimization problem using advanced network flow algorithms.

\subsection{Problem Context}

The EV charging assignment problem represents a complex optimization challenge that arises when managing electric vehicle fleets in urban environments. The problem involves multiple electric vehicles distributed across different locations, each with varying battery levels and energy consumption characteristics. These vehicles must be assigned to charging stations that have different capacities, pricing structures, and technical specifications. The road network connecting these locations introduces travel costs and energy consumption rates that must be carefully considered. The primary objective is to minimize the total operational cost, which includes both travel expenses and charging costs, while ensuring that all assignments respect critical battery constraints. Additionally, the system must account for capacity limitations at charging stations, ensuring that no station exceeds its maximum simultaneous charging capacity.

\subsection{Solution Approach}

Our solution employs a sophisticated two-phase optimization framework:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1}: Feasibility analysis using Dijkstra's algorithm to identify all possible EV-to-station assignments that satisfy energy constraints
    \item \textbf{Phase 2}: Minimum cost flow optimization using two different algorithms to find the globally optimal assignment
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Technical Challenges}

The EV charging assignment problem presents several significant computational challenges that require sophisticated algorithmic approaches. The combinatorial complexity of the problem is substantial, as the number of possible assignments grows exponentially with the number of vehicles and stations. Each electric vehicle must respect strict energy constraints, ensuring that the battery level is sufficient to reach the assigned charging station without depleting the battery during transit. Station capacity limitations create additional complexity, as the optimization must ensure that no charging station exceeds its maximum simultaneous charging capacity. The multi-objective nature of the problem requires careful balancing between travel costs and charging costs, often leading to non-trivial trade-offs. Furthermore, practical deployment demands real-time computation capabilities, requiring algorithms that can provide optimal solutions within acceptable time limits for operational use.

\section{Problem Significance}

\subsection{Real-World Impact}

The EV charging optimization problem has profound implications across multiple domains of urban infrastructure and transportation management. In urban planning, the ability to optimize charging infrastructure placement and capacity allocation enables city planners to make data-driven decisions about where to invest in charging infrastructure, maximizing coverage while minimizing redundant installations. Fleet management operations benefit significantly from efficient routing and charging strategies, allowing companies to reduce operational costs while maintaining service quality. The integration of real-time optimization capabilities into smart city frameworks enables dynamic charging station assignment that can adapt to changing demand patterns and traffic conditions. From an economic perspective, the optimization system provides substantial cost reduction opportunities by minimizing operational expenses associated with EV operations, including both direct charging costs and indirect costs such as vehicle downtime and inefficient routing. Additionally, the system contributes to energy efficiency goals by reducing unnecessary travel and optimizing charging patterns to align with renewable energy availability and grid capacity constraints.

\subsection{Economic Benefits}

Optimal EV charging assignment delivers substantial economic benefits that justify the investment in sophisticated optimization systems. The most significant advantage is operational cost reduction, which can achieve substantial savings compared to naive greedy approaches that simply assign vehicles to the nearest available station. By considering the full cost structure including travel expenses, charging rates, and opportunity costs, the optimization system can identify assignments that minimize total operational expenses. Infrastructure utilization improvements represent another key economic benefit, as the system ensures better station capacity utilization by intelligently distributing charging demand across available stations rather than allowing some stations to be overloaded while others remain underutilized. Fleet efficiency gains are achieved through higher vehicle availability and reduced downtime, as the optimization system minimizes the time vehicles spend traveling to charging stations and waiting for charging slots. From a grid perspective, coordinated charging patterns enabled by the optimization system help reduce peak demand periods, potentially leading to lower electricity costs and reduced strain on the electrical grid infrastructure.

\subsection{Environmental Impact}

The optimization system makes significant contributions to environmental sustainability goals through multiple mechanisms. Energy conservation is achieved by minimizing unnecessary travel to charging stations, as the system identifies the most efficient routes and assignments that reduce overall energy consumption across the fleet. The intelligent charging patterns enabled by the optimization system can be designed to support renewable energy integration, allowing charging to be scheduled during periods of high renewable energy availability or low grid demand. This capability is particularly valuable as cities transition to renewable energy sources and seek to maximize the environmental benefits of electric vehicle adoption. Urban air quality improvements result from more efficient EV deployment patterns that reduce the total distance traveled by vehicles seeking charging, thereby minimizing transportation-related emissions even within the electric vehicle ecosystem. The optimized routing strategies reduce overall energy consumption, which directly translates to a smaller carbon footprint for the entire charging operation, supporting broader climate change mitigation efforts.

The scenario includes 350 total units to be assigned, with balanced supply and demand, reflecting the diversity of vehicles and charging infrastructure that might be found in a real fleet. The charging stations are positioned at strategic locations, each with different capacity constraints and pricing structures that mirror real-world charging infrastructure. This scenario demonstrates the system's ability to handle real-world data and provides insights into the practical performance of the optimization algorithms when applied to actual geographic and operational constraints.

\item \textbf{Maximum Range}: 160-533 km per charge
\item \textbf{Distance Matrix}: Based on actual Cagliari road network distances
\item \textbf{Feasibility Filtering}: Only energy-feasible assignments are considered
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodological Framework}

\subsubsection{Two-Phase Optimization}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Feasibility Phase}: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find all feasible EV-station pairs
    \item \textbf{Optimization Phase}: Apply MCF algorithms to find globally optimal assignments
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Cost Modeling}

The system employs a comprehensive cost model that captures the various economic factors involved in EV charging assignments. The travel cost component is calculated based on the distance traveled, with costs reflecting typical operational expenses including fuel costs, vehicle wear, and driver time. The charging cost is determined by multiplying the energy requirement by the station's electricity price, accounting for the varying pricing structures across different charging stations. To ensure that all feasible assignments are considered and to penalize unassigned vehicles, the system incorporates a BigM penalty cost that represents a high penalty for leaving vehicles unassigned, effectively encouraging the optimization algorithm to find assignments for all vehicles whenever possible.

\section{Mathematical Formulation}

\subsection{Problem Definition}

The EV charging assignment problem can be formally represented using graph theory, where the road network is modeled as a directed graph $G = (N, A)$. In this representation, $N$ represents the set of nodes that correspond to intersections, charging stations, and other significant locations in the road network. The set $A$ contains the arcs that represent road segments connecting these nodes, with each arc carrying information about travel distance, time, and energy consumption required to traverse that segment.

\subsection{Decision Variables}

\begin{align}
x_{ij} &= \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if EV } i \text{ is assigned to station } j \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

\subsection{Objective Function}

Minimize total cost:
\begin{align}
\min \sum_{i \in \mathcal{E}} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{S}} c_{ij} x_{ij}
\end{align}

where $\mathcal{E}$ represents the set of electric vehicles that require charging, $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the set of available charging stations, and $c_{ij}$ represents the total cost associated with assigning electric vehicle $i$ to charging station $j$, incorporating both travel costs and charging expenses.

\subsection{Constraints}

\subsubsection{Assignment Constraints}
Each EV can be assigned to at most one station:
\begin{align}
\sum_{j \in \mathcal{S}} x_{ij} \leq 1 \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{E}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Capacity Constraints}
Station capacity limits:
\begin{align}
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{E}} x_{ij} \leq u_j \quad \forall j \in \mathcal{S}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Energy Feasibility Constraints}
Battery range constraints:
\begin{align}
d_{ij} \cdot \alpha_i \leq b_i \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{E}, j \in \mathcal{S}
\end{align}

where $d_{ij}$ represents the distance from electric vehicle $i$ to charging station $j$, $\alpha_i$ denotes the energy consumption rate of vehicle $i$ measured in kilowatt-hours per kilometer, and $b_i$ represents the current battery capacity of vehicle $i$ in kilowatt-hours.

\subsection{Network Flow Formulation}

The assignment problem is transformed into a minimum cost flow problem on an extended network $G' = (N', A')$. This transformation involves creating a source node that is connected to all electric vehicle nodes with unit supply, representing the requirement that each vehicle must be assigned to at most one charging station. Individual electric vehicle nodes represent each vehicle in the fleet, while station nodes represent the charging stations with their respective capacity constraints. A sink node is connected to all station nodes with demand equal to the total capacity, ensuring that the flow through the network respects the capacity limitations of each charging station.

\section{Implementation and Optimization}

\subsection{Two-Phase Architecture}

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Feasibility Analysis}

Phase 1 uses Dijkstra's algorithm to identify all feasible EV-to-station assignments:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Dijkstra-based Feasibility Analysis}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\FOR{each EV $i \in \mathcal{E}$}
    \STATE Run Dijkstra from origin node $o_i$ of EV $i$ in road network $G = (N, A)$
    \FOR{each charging station $j \in \mathcal{S}$}
        \IF{$d_{ij} \cdot \alpha_i \leq b_i$ (energy constraint satisfied)}
            \STATE Calculate $c_{ij} = c_{ij}^{travel} + c_{ij}^{charging}$
            \STATE Add $(i, j, c_{ij})$ to feasible assignments $\mathcal{F}$
        \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\RETURN Feasible assignment set $\mathcal{F}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Complete Optimization Pipeline}

The complete EV charging optimization pipeline integrates both phases:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Complete EV Charging Optimization Pipeline}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

    \FOR{each charging station $j \in \mathcal{S}$}
        \IF{$d_{ij} \cdot \alpha_i \leq b_i$ (energy constraint)}
            \STATE Calculate $c_{ij} = c_{ij}^{travel} + c_{ij}^{charging}$
            \STATE Add $(i, j, c_{ij})$ to feasible assignments $\mathcal{F}$
        \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\STATE
\STATE \textbf{Phase 2: Minimum Cost Flow Optimization}
\IF{$\mathcal{F} = \emptyset$}
    \RETURN "No feasible solution exists"
\ENDIF

\ENDIF
\STATE

\STATE Calculate $z = \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{F}} c_{ij} \cdot x_{ij}$
\RETURN Optimal assignments $x_{ij}$, total cost $z$, execution time
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Phase 2: Minimum Cost Flow Optimization}

Phase 2 converts the assignment problem into a minimum cost flow problem and solves it using two different algorithms.

\subsection{Network Construction}

The assignment problem is transformed into a bipartite flow network $G' = (N', A')$ that enables the application of efficient minimum cost flow algorithms. The network structure includes a source node that supplies unit flow to all electric vehicle nodes, ensuring that each vehicle can be assigned to at most one charging station. The electric vehicle nodes represent individual vehicles in the fleet, while the station nodes represent charging stations with their respective capacity constraints. A sink node collects flow from all station nodes with demand equal to the total capacity, creating a balanced flow network that respects both assignment constraints and capacity limitations.

\section{Algorithm Specifications}

\subsection{Successive Shortest Path (SSP) Algorithm}

The SSP algorithm finds optimal flow by augmenting along shortest paths using node potentials to maintain non-negative reduced costs. The algorithm employs Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm with reduced costs, where the reduced cost of arc $(u,v)$ is defined as $c_{\pi}(u,v) = c(u,v) + \pi(u) - \pi(v)$, where $\pi(u)$ represents the potential of node $u$. After each flow augmentation, the node potentials are updated according to the formula $\pi'(v) = \pi(v) + d(v)$ for all reachable nodes $v$, where $d(v)$ is the shortest distance from the source to node $v$.

\textbf{Complexity}: $O(V^2E \log V)$ where $V$ is the number of nodes and $E$ is the number of arcs.

\subsection{Cycle-Canceling Algorithm}

The cycle-canceling algorithm improves flow by canceling negative cycles in the residual network. The algorithm begins by finding an initial feasible flow using the Preflow-Push algorithm, which efficiently establishes a valid starting solution. Subsequently, the algorithm iteratively detects negative cost cycles using the Bellman-Ford algorithm and cancels these cycles by pushing flow around them, thereby reducing the total cost of the current flow. The process continues until no negative cycles remain in the residual network, at which point the current flow is optimal.

\textbf{Complexity}: $O(V^2E^2C)$ where $C$ is the maximum arc cost.

\subsection{Supporting Algorithms}

\subsubsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}
Dijkstra's algorithm is used for shortest path finding in the SSP approach. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of unprocessed nodes and iteratively selects the node with minimum distance for processing. For each selected node, the algorithm relaxes all outgoing arcs, updating distances to neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.

\subsubsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used for negative cycle detection in the cycle-canceling approach. The algorithm performs $V-1$ relaxation iterations over all arcs, followed by an additional iteration to detect negative cycles. If any arc can still be relaxed after $V-1$ iterations, a negative cycle exists in the network.

\subsubsection{Preflow-Push Algorithm}
The Preflow-Push algorithm is used to find an initial feasible flow for the cycle-canceling approach. The algorithm maintains node heights and pushes flow from nodes with positive excess to nodes with lower heights, using relabel operations when no push is possible.

\subsubsection{Reverse Breadth-First Search}
Reverse BFS is used to initialize node heights for the Preflow-Push algorithm. The algorithm performs a breadth-first search starting from the sink node, exploring incoming arcs to determine initial height values for all nodes.

\subsection{Theoretical Improvements}

The implementation includes several theoretical improvements following AMO network flow theory:

\subsubsection{Bellman-Ford Initialization}

    parent = [-1] * n
    
    # All-zeros initialization (AMO Section 5.2)
    dist[source] = 0
    
    # Relax arcs n-1 times

                if arc["cap"] > 0:  # Only forward arcs
                    v = arc["to"]
                    if dist[u] + arc["cost"] < dist[v]:
                        dist[v] = dist[u] + arc["cost"]
                        parent[v] = u
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Residual Network Invariants}

The implementation maintains proper residual network invariants as specified in AMO Lemma 9.11, ensuring the correctness of the network flow algorithms. The forward arc capacity is maintained as $u_{ij} - x_{ij}$, representing the remaining capacity available for flow augmentation. The backward arc capacity is set to $x_{ij}$, allowing for flow reduction operations. Cost consistency is preserved by ensuring that the reverse arc cost equals the negative of the forward arc cost, maintaining the mathematical properties required for optimal flow computation.

The algorithms exhibit efficient scaling behavior with problem size, indicating that the computational complexity remains manageable even as the number of locations and flows increases, supporting the system's potential for deployment in larger-scale urban environments. The significant performance difference between algorithms (8x speedup for SSP) provides flexibility in choosing the appropriate algorithm based on specific application requirements.

\subsubsection{Memory Efficiency}

The memory efficiency of the implementation is optimized through careful data structure design and algorithmic choices. The network representation uses adjacency lists with arc metadata, providing efficient access to network topology while minimizing memory overhead.

\subsection{Academic Value}

This project provides excellent coverage of the Graphs \& Network Optimization course, demonstrating practical applications of key algorithmic concepts taught throughout the curriculum. The implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path finding, as covered in Lecture 20, forms the foundation of the feasibility analysis phase, enabling efficient identification of viable EV-to-station assignments. The Bellman-Ford algorithm implementation, corresponding to Lectures 21-22, provides robust negative cycle detection capabilities that are essential for the cycle-canceling optimization approach. The cycle-canceling algorithm, aligned with Lectures 28-29, demonstrates advanced minimum cost flow optimization techniques that can handle complex network structures and cost functions. The Successive Shortest Path algorithm with node potentials, covered in Lecture 30, showcases sophisticated MCF optimization methods that achieve optimal solutions through iterative path augmentation and potential updates.

\subsection{Practical Impact}

The solution addresses critical real-world challenges across multiple domains of urban transportation and infrastructure management. In urban EV fleet management, the system provides optimal charging station assignment capabilities that enable fleet operators to minimize operational costs while ensuring reliable vehicle availability. The integration of real-time optimization capabilities into smart city infrastructure frameworks supports dynamic decision-making that can adapt to changing demand patterns and traffic conditions. Cost optimization represents a significant benefit, with the system achieving substantial reductions in operational expenses through intelligent assignment strategies that consider the full cost structure of EV operations. Energy efficiency improvements are realized through minimized travel distances and optimized charging patterns that reduce both direct energy consumption and indirect environmental impacts associated with inefficient vehicle routing.

\subsection{Future Work}

Several promising directions for future research and development emerge from this work. Multi-objective optimization represents a natural extension that would enable the system to balance multiple competing objectives such as cost minimization, time efficiency, and energy conservation, providing more nuanced decision-making capabilities for complex operational scenarios. Dynamic reassignment capabilities would enhance the system's practical utility by enabling real-time optimization as conditions change, such as when new vehicles enter the system, stations become unavailable, or traffic conditions alter travel times. The development of stochastic models would significantly improve the system's robustness by handling uncertainty in travel times, charging station availability, and energy consumption rates, making the optimization more reliable under real-world conditions. Large-scale deployment represents the ultimate goal, requiring algorithmic and architectural innovations to scale the system to city-wide EV networks with thousands of vehicles and hundreds of charging stations, potentially involving distributed computing approaches and advanced data structures to maintain computational efficiency at scale.
